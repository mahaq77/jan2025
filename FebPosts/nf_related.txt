**Course Title:** Mastering Angular 18 with Native Federation, NGRX, and Microfrontend Communication

**Course Overview:**
This course is designed to help developers master Angular 18, Native Federation, and NGRX while implementing microfrontend architecture. You'll learn how to establish seamless intercommunication between a shell application and microfrontends using the ES6 build process.

---

## **Module 1: Introduction to Angular 18 and Microfrontends**
- Overview of Angular 18 features and improvements
- Understanding microfrontend architecture
- Introduction to Module Federation and Native Federation
- Setting up an Angular workspace for microfrontends

## **Module 2: Setting Up Native Federation in Angular 18**
- What is Native Federation, and how does it differ from Webpack Module Federation?
- Enabling Native Federation in an Angular 18 project
- Configuring the shell and microfrontend applications
- Sharing dependencies across microfrontends
- Building and deploying microfrontends using the ES6 build process

## **Module 3: State Management with NGRX in Microfrontends**
- Introduction to NGRX and its core concepts (Store, Actions, Reducers, Effects, Selectors)
- Setting up NGRX in a shell and microfrontends
- Managing state across microfrontends
- Best practices for state management in a federated environment

## **Module 4: Intercommunication Between Shell and Microfrontends**
- Communication strategies for microfrontends (custom events, shared services, state management)
- Using NGRX for cross-microfrontend data sharing
- Implementing shared event buses with RxJS
- Handling authentication and session management
- Ensuring data consistency across microfrontends

## **Module 5: Advanced Topics and Performance Optimization**
- Lazy loading microfrontends dynamically
- Optimizing the ES6 build process for faster performance
- Security considerations for federated microfrontends
- Debugging and testing strategies for microfrontends
- CI/CD integration for microfrontend deployment

## **Module 6: Hands-on Project: Building a Fully Functional Microfrontend App**
- Setting up a real-world application with Angular 18, Native Federation, and NGRX
- Creating independent microfrontends for different features
- Implementing inter-microfrontend communication
- Deploying and testing the application

## **Help Files and Documentation**

### **1. Setting Up Angular 18 with Native Federation**
#### **Installation and Project Setup**
```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
ng new shell --standalone
ng new mfe1 --standalone
```

#### **Configuring Native Federation**
Modify `angular.json` and update the build configuration to enable Native Federation:
```json
{
  "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild",
  "options": {
    "outputPath": "dist/mfe1",
    "buildOptimizer": true,
    "aot": true
  }
}
```

### **2. Implementing NGRX in Microfrontends**
#### **Installing NGRX Dependencies**
```sh
npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/entity @ngrx/store-devtools
```

#### **Setting Up a Global Store**
Define the root state in the shell app:
```ts
import { ActionReducerMap } from '@ngrx/store';
import { appReducer } from './reducers/app.reducer';

export interface AppState {
  app: any;
}

export const reducers: ActionReducerMap<AppState> = {
  app: appReducer
};
```

### **3. Intercommunication Between Shell and Microfrontends**
#### **Using RxJS for Event-Based Communication**
Create an event bus service:
```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class EventBusService {
  private eventSubject = new Subject<any>();
  event$ = this.eventSubject.asObservable();

  emit(event: any) {
    this.eventSubject.next(event);
  }
}
```

#### **Using NGRX for Shared State**
Dispatch an action from the microfrontend:
```ts
this.store.dispatch(loadData({ payload: data }));
```

Select state in the shell app:
```ts
this.store.select(selectData).subscribe(data => console.log(data));
```

By the end of this course, you will have built a fully functional microfrontend-based Angular 18 application with seamless intercommunication using Native Federation and NGRX.
